## ðŸš‘ **Project Description: Intelligent Ambulance Routing System**

In growing urban cities like Bengaluru, traffic congestion is not just an inconvenience â€” it's a life-threatening barrier to emergency response. The delay in ambulance movement due to uncoordinated traffic can result in critical time loss, often costing lives.

Our system aims to solve this problem by creating an intelligent ambulance routing platform that enables ambulances to reach hospitals faster by dynamically clearing their route. The system uses real-time GPS data shared by the ambulance, determines the fastest possible route using Google Maps API, and actively communicates with traffic junctions to clear the way.

By integrating this data with Firebase Firestore, the system ensures real-time updates across connected modules. The backend, built in Python, handles location tracking, route optimization, and signal control logic, allowing traffic systems or authorities to receive instant alerts when an ambulance is approaching a junction.

This not only reduces response time but also enhances coordination between emergency services and traffic management systems, making urban mobility smarter and potentially life-saving.

## âœ… Key Features

* **Live Location Tracking**: Ambulance shares real-time coordinates through the app or onboard system.
* **Fastest Route Detection**: Google Maps Directions API identifies the optimal route to the destination hospital.
* **Smart Signal Coordination**: Junctions on the route are notified so that signals can be adjusted, and lanes cleared.
* **Realtime Data Flow**: Firebase Firestore stores and pushes updates instantly to all nodes (ambulance, server, junctions).
* **Scalable Backend**: Built in Python with lightweight APIs for easy integration with smart city infrastructure.

## ðŸ§  Vision

This system is a foundational step toward integrating healthcare with urban traffic systems. By creating a seamless link between ambulances and traffic control, we aim to reduce emergency response times, automate critical routing decisions, and support the long-term vision of smart, responsive cities.
